# Master Thesis Repository - Implementation and validation of an upper limb movement quality assessement tool.

This Repository contains the code and resources relevant to the master thesis of Johann Ullrich in 2024. Furthermore, unused code written as part of the project can be found in:

* [First Analysis Repository (Discontinued)](https://github.com/DART-Lab-LLUI/iDrink_DataAnalysis)
* [iDrink prototype](https://github.com/DART-Lab-LLUI/iDrink_GUI)

The project implements a pipeline that reconstructs 3D-keypoints from several video recordings and calculates the inverse kinematics and measures for movement quality.
